records in the database corresponding to different races. The rank variable corresponds to the placement achieved by
the athlete overall in the corresponding year's competition.
Note that the dataset provided was scraped by us and has not been manually sanitized. It is possible that errors are
present (e.g. inconsistent format for the “Time”, missing data, etc.).
